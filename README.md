Most of the News Aggregator API shared in the instruction have changed their base plan to some sort of payment with huge rate limiting (not very suitable for development). But NewsAPI.org still gives up 100 requests per day/developer

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
